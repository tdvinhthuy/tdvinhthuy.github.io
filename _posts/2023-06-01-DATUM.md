***

Yasser Benigmim et al. propose to fine-tune DreamBooth with the prompt: "A photo of sks urban scene".

<div>
    <img src="/assets/img/news/DATUM/sks-urban-scene.jpg" width="100%">
    <div class="img-cap">
        <b>Figure 1.</b> Training prompt: A photo of <b>sks</b> urban scene
    </div>
</div>

We will make experiments on the this image to answer the corresponding questions in below. The training configuration remains as default.
#### 1. What will happen if the training prompt does not indicate exactly the style of the input ?

We would like to see if the invalid training prompt affects the quality of the fine-tuned model. The answer is yes. Most of the generated images with respect to the class rainy do not contain the rain. For the classes <i>snowy</i> and <i>sunny</i>, the outputs seems good but people and cars almost disappear.

#### 2. How does the model work if the classes are not relevant to the style ?
When the classes are not relevant to the style (e.g. "paddy field", "moutain"), the fine-tuned model with the correct training prompt are still able to generate valid images. The model trained with invalid prompt lost its generalized capability.

        <img src="/assets/img/news/DATUM/a_photo_of_sks_class_sky.png" width="49%">
        <div class="img-cap">
            <b>Figure 5.</b> Test prompt: A photo of <b>sks</b> &lt;class&gt;.  &lt;class&gt; from left to right: urban scene - paddy field - mountain - sky. Training prompt: "A photo of <b>sks</b> urban scene" (Left) vs "A photo of <b>sks</b> sky" (Right). Fine-tune in 200 iterations
        </div>
    </div>

#### 3. Try to synthesize images in different weather conditions
Training the following image under rainy condition.
<div>
    <img src="/assets/img/news/DATUM/sks-urban-scene-rainy-day.jpg" width="100%">
    <div class="img-cap">
        <b>Figure 6.</b> Training prompt: A photo of <b>sks</b> urban scene on a rainy day
    </div>
</div>
The fine-tuned model learns the piles as a style.
<div>
    <img src="/assets/img/news/DATUM/sks-urban-scene-weather-200.png" width="100%">
    <div class="img-cap">
        <b>Figure 7.</b> Test prompt: A photo of <b>sks</b> &lt;class&gt;.  &lt;class&gt; from top to bottom: sunny - rainy - snowy. Training prompt: "A photo of <b>sks</b> urban scene" (Left) vs "A photo of <b>sks</b> sky" (Right). Fine-tune in 200 iterations
    </div>
</div>
When train with 1000 iterations, the model overfits and cannot generate images with respect to <i>sunny</i> and <i>snowy</i>. Moreover, the <i>rainy</i>, <i>piles</i>, <i>purple color</i>, <i>people riding bikes with raincoat</i>, etc. are also consider to be the style.
